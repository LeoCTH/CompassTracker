# CompassTracker
a 🅱️ukkit plugin that makes compasses track other people,
similar to the one that Dream and his team featured on countless video series (primarily Manhunt), 
written from scratch.

PS:
only tested for mc 1.16.x,
*might be* compatible with any version from 1.13 onwards
due to the use of the PersistentDataHolder api.  
a legacy port is **not** planned.

### can i use it
sure  
(an attribution would be nice :o)
